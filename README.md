bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
For Windows:
cmdpython -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt:
bashpip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Configure API Key
Create a .env file in the project root directory and add your Google Generative AI (Gemini) API key:
envGEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
5️⃣ Download Datasets
Download the required datasets from the following links and place them in the appropriate project directory:

Raw Data: Download here
Normalized Data: Download here


⚠️ Important: Ensure both datasets are downloaded and extracted to the correct location before running the project.

6️⃣ Run the Project
Execute the main script to start the application:
bashpython test.py
