ü§ñ AI Code Assistant Project
An intelligent assistant for generating and analyzing Python code, powered by Google Generative AI (Gemini), aider-chat, and custom prompt-based logic.

üöÄ Overview
This project provides a robust solution for automating Python code generation and analysis, leveraging advanced AI tools to streamline development workflows.

üîß Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Set up a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:
For Linux/macOS:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

For Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure API Key
Create a .env file in the project root directory and add your Google Generative AI (Gemini) API key:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

5Ô∏è‚É£ Download Datasets
Download the required datasets from the following links and place them in the appropriate project directory:

Raw Data: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JuoqJGkzN_KLQKQmL2mzwJuwZKlBNIaa/view?usp=sharing
Normalized Data: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TuZ7pOpJtiDSh-mezr3Y44FCFCTppDe2/view?usp=sharing

Ensure both datasets are downloaded and extracted to the correct location before running the project.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Project
Execute the main script (test.py) to start the application:
python test.py


üìù Notes
you should change ideas.json for suitable task
Ensure your system has Python 3.7+ installed.
Verify that the .env file is correctly configured with a valid Gemini API key.
Place the downloaded datasets in the appropriate directory as specified in your project configuration.
